 <h1>  Description </h1>

   <strong> <p> <en>French toast is a dish made of sliced
         bread soaked in eggs and typically milk, then fried.
         Alternative names and variants include eggy bread,
         Bombay toast, German toast, gypsy toast, poor knights (of Windsor), torrija and Arme Riddere. 
         The earliest known reference to French toast is in the Apicius, a collection of Latin recipes dating to the 4th or 5th century, 
         where it is described as simply aliter dulcia ('another sweet dish'). The recipe says to "slice fine white bread, remove the crust, and break it into large pieces. 
         Soak these pieces in milk and beaten egg, fry in oil, and cover with honey before serving." </en> </p> </strong>
